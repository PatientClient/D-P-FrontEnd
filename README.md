**DOCTOR-PATIENT COMMUNICATION**



<a name="br3"></a> 

INTRODUCTION

q My Project is a system that help doctors to

track their elderly patients and manage

healthcare tasks and activities.

q The system includes two separate

applications: one for **doctors** and one for

**patients**.

q The **doctor** application allows doctors to :

\- **create** and manage daily tasks for their

patients

\- **track** patient progress in real-time, and

manage their information.

q The **patient** application:

\- lets patients view their assigned **tasks**,

mark

them as complete,

\- choose **an activity** to apply to it .

Doctor Application:

The doctor application provides the following key features for healthcare management:

• **Patients Management**: Manage patient information and track their progress.

• **Daily Tasks Management**: Assign daily tasks to patients with specific time frames, and track completion.

• **Activities Management**: Allow patients to select an activity for the day, and track completion.

• **Dashboard**: Provide a real-time view of patients and their current status.

• **Messaging and Alerting**: real-time alerts to doctors when patients have completed tasks or when their

progress is off track.

Patient Application:

The Patient application provides the following

features :

• **Assigned Tasks :** Patients can view the tasks

assigned to them by their doctor and mark them as

completed when finished.

• **Activities :** Patients can select activities from a list

provided by their doctor and mark them as completed

when finished.

Why Tw o Applications and Microservices Architecture (with ‘RabbitMQ’  Message Broker):

• **Microservices architecture** allows teams to deploy **independent** applications without **affecting** other

services in the architecture.

• If one or more applications in the system **fail**, the rest of the system will not be **affected**.

• **Scalability** system can handle more requests at the same time , which means that users can access the

system faster .

**Message Broker** :

• A message broker is **software that enables applications, systems, and services to communicate**

**with each other and exchange information**.

• **Message broker** can store messages even if the receiving system is not currently connected or

available.

I learned from this project

Future futures

¡ **Real-time communication**: using a message

¡ **Improved User Experience for Elderly**

broker and microservices architecture.

**Patients**

¡ **Message broker**: RabbitMQ as a message

broker to enable communication between

microservices.

¡ **Family Member Application**

¡ **Activity Management**: videos, photos, and

location data to patient activities

¡ **Microservices architecture**: implement a

microservices architecture to build scalable

and maintainable applications.

¡ **statistics and analytics** capabilities to

provide more insights and improve decision-

making processes.

¡ **Prime React:** I used the UI library Prime

React to create a modern and responsive user

interface for the application.

overcoming Cchallenge's

¡ I had to build a project in just **two weeks** which was a challenging deadline.

¡ The project required me to learn **new** concepts such as **message** broker and **microservice**

**architecture**.

¡ I had to split the time for **learning** and **implementing** what I learned.
